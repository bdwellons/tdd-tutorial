# tdd-tutorial
A simple Test Driven Development project using NodeJS and Chai

To run:
* npm install

To run tests and watch for file changes:
* npm run-script test

To run tests once and generate coverage files:
* npm run-script coverage


It should load the tests and begin with all but one failing. As you make updates to app/tdd-tutorial.js and save, the tests should update as well.
Use the descriptions from the unit tests to determine what is missing.
